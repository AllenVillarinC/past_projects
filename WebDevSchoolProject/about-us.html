        <h1>Website Origins:</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 25px">
          Ninth Sixteenth was an idea created by amateur photographers looking
          for more photographic ideas to apply in their work. They were a group
          of enthusiastic photographers who loved to capture memorable moments
          or events such as weddings, fashion, and sports. Their expertise in
          capturing these types of events continued beyond there. They also
          capture portraits and wildlife photos producing the finest detail
          possible.
          <br /><br />
          After years of capturing photos, they have gotten recognition from
          their local people and are asked to take their photos for them. This
          group then decided to make a website dedicated to their local people
          to book photographers, such as themselves, for upcoming events. To
          this fact, Ninth Sixteenth was born, which started from just being
          local to provincial, to national, and finally worldwide.
          <br /><br />
          Ninth Sixteenth is looking for enthusiastic amateur photographers
          worldwide who are eager to learn new ideas and share their ideas with
          their colleagues. Our goal is to cover every corner of the world and
          capture photos for their clients and the whole world.
